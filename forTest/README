When building, the following files may differ among dev, test, prod:
IGSPnet_Cookie_Config.h = SOCKET_PATH, DB_CONN_STRING, DB_USER, DB_PASS
RSA_Sign_Verify.cpp = private and public keys
Makefile = LIBSTDC will vary depending on 32 or 64 bit
cookied = COOKIEDAEMON_DIR

All binaries now support the -svn argument, which will print the position in the svn tree of the software.
Please update the SVNPOS constant in IGSPnet_Cookie_Config.h to correspond to this value, relative to
the root of the svn tree (e.g. 'current', 'branches/foo', 'tags/foo', etc.)
